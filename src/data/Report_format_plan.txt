Methods needed:
- private ReadInventory() , this will at the same time as has read a value enter it into the list
  We do know that all the three seperate files are all in the same order.
  Therefore we can add the values to the object in order, so first up is creating an empty object.
  Add that to the list and add the current available value from one of the txt and continue until the
  first txt is empty. Do the same for the second and third txt until all data is collected in the list.
  There after we can display in the format listed above.

- public DisplayReports() , is called after Loadfromfile.
